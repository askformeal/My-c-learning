This repository was called My-c-learning, but I was actually learning C++. The book I use was C++ Prime, English editor, although I'm a Chinese. :) I'm getting ready for 
a big programming contest in Orc. I write down all the codes in the book and name them after the part of the book they are. For example, the 1.4.2.cpp is in the 1.4.2 
section of the book.
